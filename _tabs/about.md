Hi, I’m Duc. 

I’ve always been curious about how systems work and how they can be broken. That curiosity pulled me into the world of security and hacking challenges, where every puzzle is a chance to learn something new.

This blog is my notebook. I write down the problems I’ve tackled, the process I used to solve them, and the little lessons I pick up along the way. Sometimes it’s a full walkthrough of a challenge, other times it’s just me thinking out loud about an idea that caught my attention.

If you’re into technology, challenges, puzzles, or just enjoy following along with someone trying to figure things out, I hope you’ll find something useful here. Feel free to reach out me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamphduc)
